CHANGES TO THE DETECTOR GEOMETRY (i.e. DetectorConstruction.cc/hh):

The only things I added to the simulation geometry is NaI detector 3.

This is the NaI crystal found on the table next to the mass slit box.

The specifications are found here:

The particular type is Mod. 2M2/2

Furthermore, I actually also changed the aluminum port cover geometry. The actual geometry was missing the stainless steel neck 
and flange. Also the measurements were way off. 

I also added the two lead bricks next to the NaI detector. Their positions don't look quite right but the measurements
are pretty close relative to the NaI pmt on the table. Just leave it, it's probably at most off by a cm or two and in this
case it really doesn't matter since they would need to cause such sharp scattering in order to trigger in the crystal.
